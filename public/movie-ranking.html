 <h2>My Recent Watched Movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
 <p>Watched this opening weekend and it was very well done. The jokes landed and the music picked for it was supurb.</p>

 <h3>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
 <p>Watched this one with mom at the cabin a few weeks ago. Those practical effects still hold up even now.</p>

 <h3>The Mummy</h3>
 <p>Watched this with my cousin Sam and I had forgotten how well done it was. </p>
